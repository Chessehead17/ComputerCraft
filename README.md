# ComputerCraft Programs

These are Programs for the Mod Computercraft. Currently that mod is defunct and has been replaced by a mod called CC:Tweaked.
These Programs currently work with both of these mods. Installing the "install" file will download all currently functional programs. If you only need one of them then just download the individual programs to the computer in game.

## Installation

To install this **Program Suit** you will need to two commands. First will download the installer and then the second will run the installer.

1. ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chessehead17/ComputerCraft/main/install.lua install```
2. ```install```

## Updates

The installer is can just be re-run to reinstall the programs from the this suit. To update the installer use the update argument. This will download the latest version of the installer and replace itself. Simply run the installer again as normal to install the additional programs that the installer has added.

- ```install update```
